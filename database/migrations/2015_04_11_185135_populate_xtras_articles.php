It would be easy to accidentally get the wrong version. By forcing Xtras to have separate versions for each version of Nova, everything from preview images, version history, installation instructions, and downloads are clearer.", 'keywords' => 'versions', 'tags' => [5]],

In the future, when Nova 3 is released, we'll open it up to more people.

Help!", 'content' => "We use slugs for identifying specific Xtras. What that means is that we take the name of an Xtra and replace spaces with dashes (-) and strip special characters. So if you have an Xtra name \"My Awesome Xtra\", it's slug will be `my-awesome-xtra`. If you try to create \"My Awesome Xtra\" for Nova 1 and then \"My Awesome Xtra\" for Nova 2, it won't let you create the second version because you already have an Xtra with the slug of `my-awesome-xtra`.\r\n\r\nTo get around this limitation (something we had to figure out for all of our own Xtras), name your Xtras with a Nova version number: \"My Awesome Xtra Nova 1\". After you've created the Xtra, upload the file, and uploaded your preview images, go back and edit the Xtra and remove the \"Nova 1\" piece of the name. The slug won't change, so the slug will remain `my-awesome-xtra-nova-1`, but you'll have a cleaner name.", 'keywords' => 'error, versions', 'tags' => [5]],
